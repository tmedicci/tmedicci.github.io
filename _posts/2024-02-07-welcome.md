Welcome to my website! My name is Tiago, I'm a software engineer and I write about embedded systems, electronics, programming and technology in English and Portuguese.

You can check more about me (and this website) in the [`About`]({% link about.md %}) section.

This is the place where I share projects and findings that might be useful for someone. Most of the content was already published in other places - in English and/or Portuguese - but this is a "safe" place to have them backed up. I'll let you know when and where they were already published.

Please, feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to hear anything or discuss anything :wink:
