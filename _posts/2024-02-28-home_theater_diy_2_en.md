Home Theater DIY - The Saga of the Loudspeakers
===============================================

## Subwoofer

Continuing updating this series, I'll talk about the subwoofer that I built to enhance the system. The addition of a bass unit is always welcome, especially for movies.
For music, however, it is dispensable considering that the front speakers - as I will be calling the bookshelf speakers from the previous post - have a great bass response for 6" midbass drivers.

Here it is the brief post I made about the subwoofer in the CLUBE DIY ÁUDIO group on Facebook:

The box was built using 30mm MDF (two 15mm sheets overlapped) - with internal reinforcement. The baffle is recessed in relation to the front dimensions of the box so that the front screen could be fitted and thus I did not need to make the speaker recess. The front speacker protection screen is fitted with neodymium magnets, making it easy to remove. The final finish was done with "screened" fabric (known in Brazil as "telinha") - it provides a sophisticated look when used with the front screen. For now, it is being powered by a ~60W RMS Gainclone (at 4 Ohms).

As I've said in this post, I already had two other components of the system that I will soon post here: the side and central speakers and the Gainclone amplifiers. However, the media center was still missing. I will post about these components soon :wink:

Stay tuned for news!
